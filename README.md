The project aims to promote environmental responsibility among Ukrainian citizens through the use of Solana blockchain technology.

This example application is written in Rust, TypeScript (React).

## Project structure

 - The `backend` folder contains the Rust smart contract, used mostly for authentication purposes.
 - The `dip20` folder contains the Rust smart contract, used for DIP20 token logic (currency for bonuses).
 - The `nft` folder contains the Rust smart contract, used for DIP20 toke logic (bonuses).
 - The `storage` folder contains the Rust smart contract, built to store recycling records of users.
 - The `frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written using the React framework.

## Description

The project aims to promote environmental responsibility among Ukrainian citizens through the use of Solana blockchain technology.

Anyone who brings waste to the "Ukraine Without Waste" station receives tokens, which can be used to purchase NFTs that grant discounts at partner store chains as a reward for their contribution to recycling.

## How It Works

1. A person arrives at the "Ukraine Without Waste" station with recyclable waste.
2. They take a photo of themselves in front of the station's sign along with the waste they brought.
3. They upload the photo to a mobile app or web platform powered by ICP.
4. They receive 1,000 SPL20 tokens in their balance.
5. On the project's partner offers page, users can purchase three types of NFTs, which grant discounts at partner stores.

## Expected Results

 - An increase in the number of people who sort and recycle waste.
 - The development of a culture of environmental responsibility.
 - The promotion of blockchain and Web3 technology in social initiatives.
 - The creation of a sustainable incentive mechanism for recycling.
